    <p style = " font-family:cursive; font-weight:bold">
        Revati is considered as a nakshatra that nourishes and brings prosperity, growth, and vitality. Revati is excellent to start a new journey, marriage ceremonies, conceiving a child, or purchasing new clothes. The nakshatra is represented by fish depicting learning and movement. Revati folks are often good looking and extroverted. They can be the life of any party and stand out from the crowd, wherever they go. They possess strong intuition because of which they can make the right decisions most of the time. However, sometimes they can get carried away, as a result of being empathetic. Their empathy burns them out completely, as they go out and about to help people before having their needs met. Revati Nakshatra is highly compatible with Bharani nakshatra. Apart from Bharani nakshatra, they also find happiness and solace with Punarvasu, Pushya, Anuradha, Hasta, and Uttara-Bhadra. They can be very good writers, journalists, entertainers, and religious workers.<br><br>
