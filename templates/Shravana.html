        Shravana Nakshatra is known by many names, such as Sravana, Shravan, or Thiruvonam. It is the 22nd Nakshatra in the list of 27 Nakshatras. Shravana Nakshatra is spread across the Makara Rashi or the Capricorn zodiac sign, and the creator, Lord Vishnu is the ruler. Shravana Nakshatra consists of three stars Altair, Alshain, and Tarazed. These three stars together form the head of Aquila, the Eagle. To put it simply, the word Shravana means ‘Hearing’, and the symbol is ‘The Ear’ because of which we hear. Shravana Nakshatra is the star of listening and learning. Our ancestors passed on the knowledge through oral traditions, similarly, people born under Shravana Nakshatra have a great ability to absorb all the knowledge through listening. As the main idea is to listen and learn, the media and communication field are basically part of this nakshatra. Those born under Shravana Nakshatra often travel to foreign lands to seek more wisdom and do their higher education.

        Moon is the ruling planet of Shravana Nakshatra, and it represents the highest point of lunar energy. The night sky casts an eagle-shaped constellation that corresponds to the Shravana Nakshatra symbol of three footprints. This Nakshatra signifies the art of hearing or the education and knowledge that is gained via listening. The symbol of three footprints can be associated with Lord Vishnu, the creator. An interesting fact is that it is also the birth start of Goddess Saraswati, the goddess of education and knowledge. In addition to this, Shravana nakshatra blesses its native with a wealth of knowledge, educational proficiency, and intelligence.
